🎓 University Projects & Exercises (Portfolio)

Welcome to Main, a central repository hosting the bulk of my university work throughout my Computer Science degree, along with assorted programming exercises and web development practice. This is a portfolio-style repository that showcases the growth of my skills, the variety of problems I’ve tackled, and the technologies I’ve learned along the way.

It’s not a single focused application — it’s a curated collection of coursework and learning projects that together represent my practical experience in software development and computer science.

📌 What’s in This Repository

This repository contains organized folders and files representing:

🧑‍💻 Computer Science Coursework

These are structured projects from my university classes, covering topics such as:

Algorithms and data structures

Object-oriented programming

Databases and SQL

Operating systems fundamentals

Formal Language and Compilers

Other core CS subjects

Each subfolder or project typically includes:

Source code

Documentation or reports (where applicable)

README or notes specific to that project

These documents collectively show how my programming skills evolved over time.

💻 Independent & Practice Projects

In addition to formal coursework, this repo also includes:

Small web-development exercises (HTML / CSS / JavaScript)

Personal practice projects

Mini-assignments to reinforce key concepts

Examples of problem-solving outside of coursework

These can range from beginner exercises to more complex labs.

🧪 Miscellaneous Learning Materials

You might also find:

Notes

Scratch code snippets

Concept prototypes

Deprecated projects (kept for reference)

📂 Common Technologies Used

Across different projects in this repository, you’ll find a mix of:

Category	Languages / Tools
Programming	Java, C#, Python, C/C++
Web Development	HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Database	SQL (MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQLite)
